Topic: C-3 Text-guided Image Editing through Latent Modification in VAEs.

Group Members: Lingyun Guo, Ruizhi Niu, Wenyue Yang, Yile Ji



## The team has currently tried two implementation methods:
1. Training a CVAE model with CLIP-generated text features jointly with the original images, enabling the model to perform semantic image editing.
2. Using a pre-trained VAE model, we perform latent-space editing by linear shift, interpolation and latent optimization.


## Operating environment and deployment:
All the codes were completed using Colab, upload the notebook files to Colab and it will be ready to run.
You can also view the output in /notebook.
