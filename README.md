Topic: C-3 Text-guided Image Editing through Latent Modification in VAEs 
Group Members: Lingyun Guo, Ruizhi Niu, Wenyue Yang, Yile Ji

The team has currently tried two implementation methods:
1. Training a CVAE model with CLIP-generated text features jointly with the original images, enabling the model to perform semantic image editing.
2. Using a pre-trained VAE model, we perform latent-space editing by computing direction vectors, which allows us to achieve image editing through image completion.
