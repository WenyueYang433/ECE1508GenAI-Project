Topic: C-3 Text-guided Image Editing through Latent Modification in VAEs 
Group Members: Lingyun Guo, Ruizhi Niu, Wenyue Yang, Yile Ji

The team has currently tried two implementation methods:
1. Train a CVAE model, using the prompt feature generated by Clip along with the original image for training.-- The model is capable of editing images through semantics.
2. Utilizing a pre-trained VAE model, achieving the effect of image editing through latent space editing and the calculation of direction vectors -- capable of editing images
